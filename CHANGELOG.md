# Changelog

## 1.0 — unreleased

First build, to the *Weight Tracker — build specification* (Rev 2026-08-27).

### Assumptions this build makes

These are choices, not neutral defaults. Section 4 of the specification asks for
the first one to be recorded here; the rest are noted for the same reason.

- **Several Health Connect records on the same day: the earliest one wins.** The
  assumption is a morning weigh-in, before breakfast, which is the reading most
  people intend to track. A scale that syncs an evening reading too will have it
  discarded. Section 14 lists confirming this against real scale behaviour as
  still open.
- **A new plan pins its start to your most recent entry**, not to the beginning
  of your history. The plan line therefore begins the day you set the goal.
  Editing an existing plan never moves the start.
- **Backdated entries written to Health Connect are stamped 08:00 local**, for
  the same morning-weigh-in reason. Today's entry is stamped with the actual
  time.
- **Writing manual entries back to Health Connect defaults on** whenever the
  write permission has been granted, which section 14 lists as still open.
- **Background sync is in the free tier**, not behind the widget unlock, which
  section 14 also lists as still open.
- **A trend projection more than ten years out is hidden** rather than shown, on
  top of the specification's rule that the trend must run in the right direction
  and have at least two entries behind it.

### Known gaps

- Google sign-in, Play Billing and AdMob need IDs from a real account before
  they do anything; see the README. Without them sign-in says so plainly,
  the paywall reports that Play is unreachable, and the banner shows Google's
  test creative.
- Signing in records the account and states that the plan is backed up, but no
  backup service is wired up behind it yet.
- Lock-screen placement for the glance widget depends on the launcher; it is
  declared for both the keyguard and home-screen categories.
